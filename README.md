# Network-Topology-and-Packet-Flow-Visualization


This repository provides a solution to the Packet Flow Visualizer problem statement, focusing on creating a visual representation of packet flow within a college network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The project includes the creation of a network topology and an analysis of packet flow from students' laptops/desktops to external networks.

**Key Features:**
- Cisco Packet Tracer file (`Packet_Tracer_File.pkt`) illustrating the network topology.
- Documentation in the `docs/` folder, providing insights into the network design, OSI model layers, and device roles.
- Educational insights derived from packet flow investigation and analysis.

**How to Use:**
1. Download and install Cisco Packet Tracer from [NetAcad](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer).
2. Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
3. Load the Packet Tracer file (`Packet_Tracer_File.pkt`) from this repository.

**Disclaimer:**
This Packet Tracer file is intended for educational purposes, showcasing network topology and packet flow analysis within a controlled environment.

**Contributions and Acknowledgments:**
Contributions and feedback are welcome. Acknowledgments to tools, resources, or guidance related to the project are appreciated.
