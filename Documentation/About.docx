## Packet Flow Visualizer Documentation

## Project Overview

The Packet Flow Visualizer project aims to create a visual representation of packet flow within a college network, emphasizing the path from students' laptops/desktops to external networks. The solution involves network topology creation using Cisco Packet Tracer and packet flow investigation.

## Repository Contents

1. `Packet_Tracer_File.pkt`
   - Cisco Packet Tracer file illustrating the network topology.

2. `README.md`
   - Readme file providing an overview of the project, how to use the Packet Tracer file, and important information.

3. `LICENSE.txt`
   - License file specifying the terms under which the project is released. (See below for the modified license text.)

4. `docs/`
   - Folder containing additional documentation related to the project.
     - `Packet_Flow_Analysis.pdf`: Detailed insights into packet flow investigation and analysis.
     - `Network_Topology_Overview.pdf`: Overview of the created network topology.

5. Screenshots or Demo
   - Include screenshots or a demo video showcasing the network topology and packet flow within Cisco Packet Tracer.

## How to Use the Packet Tracer File

To view the network topology and packet flow within Cisco Packet Tracer, follow these steps:

1. Download and install Cisco Packet Tracer from [NetAcad](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer).
2. Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
3. Load the Packet Tracer file (`Packet_Tracer_File.pkt`) from this repository.

## Educational Insights

The project provides the following educational insights:
